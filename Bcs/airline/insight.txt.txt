Route profitability varies significantly with a few high-demand domestic routes generating strong revenue while several long-haul international routes show higher operational costs and lower margins

Seat occupancy rates remain strong overall indicating healthy demand but certain routes with below-average occupancy directly contribute to reduced profitability

Aircraft type affects route performance with larger long-range aircraft showing higher operating costs and lower profit on low-demand routes

Monthly trends reveal seasonal fluctuations with profits increasing during peak travel months and dropping sharply during off-season periods

Several routes show high revenue but low or negative profit suggesting the need to optimize pricing aircraft allocation or reduce operational expenses

Domestic routes outperform international routes in profit consistency mainly due to shorter durations lower fuel cost and higher seat utilization
